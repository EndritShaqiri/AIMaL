# AIMAL â€“ Artificially Intelligent Malware Launcher

**AIMAL** is a red team simulation framework built for testing modern malware evasion techniques against AV, EDR, and IDS. It supports modular evasion techniques like Process Herpaderping, Process Hollowing, Thread Hijacking, and Process Ghosting, combined with AI-assisted mutation logic, stealthy payloads, and real-time feedback adaptation.

AIMAL integrates with the OpenAI API to dynamically suggest evasive actions based on simulated alerts (e.g., behavioral or signature detection). It can autonomously apply countermeasures like shellcode polymorphism, PPID spoofing, syscall chain mutation, and noise injection â€” transforming detection into adaptation.

> **Current payloads:**  
> - Stealth AES-encrypted reverse shell  
> - Silent ransomware variant (*in development*)  
> - More to come...
